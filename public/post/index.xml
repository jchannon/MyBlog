      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <title>I’ve started blogging. Why?</title>
      <link>/2012-09-17-ive-started-blogging-why/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here I am, Jonathan Channon, blogger.  I never saw the point of blogging before so why now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read and spoken to many people regarding blogging who were all in favour of it.  I would always argue that I don’t have time, I have nothing to blog about or I’m not that insane to start blogging about stuff I barely understand just so the masses can come and hurl abuse at my ignorance.  However I recently read an &lt;a href=&#34;http://buildstarted.com/2012/08/28/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-my-community/&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/buildstarted&#34;&gt;Ben Dornis&lt;/a&gt; titled “How I learned to stop worrying and love my community”.  He outlined all the reasons why a lot of people don’t publish their code and don’t publish their thoughts online. I thought he was being modest, the man is clearly talented at what he does so he didn’t have to worry however, someone like me still had these fears.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
