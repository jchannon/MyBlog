      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I said in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/17/ive-started-blogging-why/&#34; title=&#34;I’ve started blogging. Why?&#34;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;, NancyFX was my first port of call in my OSS adventure.  The reason I had come across it was by following &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/squidge&#34;&gt;@squidge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/cranialstrain&#34;&gt;@cranialstrain&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.  At the time they were talking about it quite a bit so I thought I’d take a look.  I was also keeping track of lots of people talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://ravendb.net&#34;&gt;RavenDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-nancyfx&#34;&gt;What is NancyFX?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official docs this explains NancyFX:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This means that everything in Nancy is setup to have sensible defaults and conventions, instead of making you jump through hoops and go through configuration hell just to get up and running. With Nancy you can go from zero to website in a matter of minutes. Literally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
