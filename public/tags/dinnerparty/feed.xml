      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in &lt;a href=&#34;http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/09/17/announcing-great-improvements-to-windows-azure-web-sites.aspx&#34;&gt;July 2012&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft announced improvements to Azure Web Sites. One of those improvements was to Git publishing so when you pushed changes to your Github repository Azure would automatically pick that up and deploy the project. I even mentioned it in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me/&#34; title=&#34;NancyFX, RavenDB, NerdDinner and Me&#34;&gt;DinnerParty blog post&lt;/a&gt; but have only just looked at implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in my previous post Azure supported Git publishing but it was a two step process. You push to Github and then push to Azure and it gets deployed. If you already have Git setup on your Azure account there is nowhere in the dashboard that allows to you setup Github integration. I thought I was going to have reset my deployment credentials and set it all up again when I asked the question on &lt;a href=&#34;http://jabbr.net&#34;&gt;Jabbr&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/davidfowl&#34;&gt;David Fowler&lt;/a&gt; was online. Why is that lucky? He wrote the Github integration feature of Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To setup your Azure account to enable Github integration you have to FTP into your Azure account and delete the deployment history by deleting all contents in the /site/deployments folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deployment History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Logging into websites is no longer a matter of typing in your username and password and clicking the login button. If you already have an account with the main social networks you can log into a site using your credentials from that website saving you having to register your details &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;. This obviously makes things a bit easier as you don’t have to remember another password. (Although you should all be using a password manager such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lastpass.com&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-social-login-providers&#34;&gt;Current Social Login Providers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently providers out there that allow you to use their services to integrate into your website to provide authentication via the social networks. The main two that I know of are &lt;a href=&#34;http://janrain.com&#34;&gt;Janrain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dotnetopenauth.net/&#34;&gt;DotNetOpenAuth&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve not worked with DotNetOpenAuth but I have with Janrain when building &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me/&#34;&gt;DinnerParty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process was reasonably easy but not as simple as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
