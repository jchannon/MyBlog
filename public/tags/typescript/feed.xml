      <title>Up &amp; Running with TypeScript and WebStorm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love my iMac and I’m on a mission to find a language I enjoy that I can use my Mac for (no Windows fan boy jokes please). There’s something in my mind I associate with work and my Windows laptop. Therefore, I don’t feel to excited about getting my laptop out of my bag in the evenings/weekends to play with other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I want to broaden my knowledge I wanted to find something ideally statically typed (although I’m currently looking into Python) that would work on OS X. I’ve said previously that JavaScript seems the way to go in my current situation so I thought I’d take a look at TypeScript and also use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/&#34;&gt;WebStorm&lt;/a&gt; from Jetbrains as my IDE seeing as I’ve heard so many great things about them and their products (don’t worry I use ReSharper).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;typescript&#34;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went over to TypeScript’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.typescriptlang.org/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and followed the Hello World type code examples under the “Learn” tab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Old Development Language Switcheroo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a C# developer I think I’m pretty safe in saying that its not going away any time soon however, its my opinion that to not become irrelevant you need to have options. Some may argue that its better to be master of one than a Jack of all trades but lets just say you can’t find your next job in the primary language you want to work in. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have looked more into JavaScript recently and with that comes server and client scope for the use of the language so with some understanding of JS that would be probably the best bet for me however, as much as this may annoy some I think I actually prefer statically typed languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.typescriptlang.org/&#34;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; that I could use for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; apps but I see that as more of a workaround and not a core feature of JavaScript. I’m not saying anything bad against JS and the libraries/frameworks that I have used I like but I just find it easier to learn and know what I can do when I have decent intellisense showing me what I can do with my code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript is the future…maybe!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not one for New Years resolutions but I thought it was time I looked at JavaScript more in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/10/08/node-js-express-hello-world-formula-1-style/&#34; title=&#34;Node.js, Express, Hello World Formula 1 Style&#34;&gt;Node.js a while back&lt;/a&gt; and found it very interesting and I probably need to go back to it. Over the last month or so there has been a large discussion about async in .Net frameworks and there appears to be a lot of misunderstanding about it (and lets leave it at that, I don’t want to start another flame war) but the thing we can definitely say with &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;, well JavaScript to be fair is that it is perfectly asynchronous and non-blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a web developer I have used JavaScript from the early days of Response.Write moving onto frameworks such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://script.aculo.us/&#34;&gt;script.aculo.us&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mootools.net/&#34;&gt;MooTools&lt;/a&gt; and finally ending up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://jquery.com/&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; which has come pretty much a standard these days so my JavaScript skills are not completely new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there has been a large push to use JS more and more for rich user friendly applications with things like &lt;a href=&#34;http://knockoutjs.com/&#34;&gt;KnockoutJS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://angularjs.org/&#34;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://backbonejs.org/&#34;&gt;BackboneJS&lt;/a&gt; on the client and Node.js on the server. Microsoft has even taken a prominent role in helping bring Node.js to a Windows environment as it started out on *nix based platforms. They have also started contributing to and including scripts in their Visual Studio project templates for jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
