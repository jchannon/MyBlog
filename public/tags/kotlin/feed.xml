      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a C# developer I think I’m pretty safe in saying that its not going away any time soon however, its my opinion that to not become irrelevant you need to have options. Some may argue that its better to be master of one than a Jack of all trades but lets just say you can’t find your next job in the primary language you want to work in. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have looked more into JavaScript recently and with that comes server and client scope for the use of the language so with some understanding of JS that would be probably the best bet for me however, as much as this may annoy some I think I actually prefer statically typed languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.typescriptlang.org/&#34;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; that I could use for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; apps but I see that as more of a workaround and not a core feature of JavaScript. I’m not saying anything bad against JS and the libraries/frameworks that I have used I like but I just find it easier to learn and know what I can do when I have decent intellisense showing me what I can do with my code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
