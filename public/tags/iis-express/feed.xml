      <description>I was playing around with swagger-ui and was trying to point it to a local endpoint that I started with IIS Express. I was getting an error saying that it needed the endpoint to accept Access-Control-Allow-Origin requests.
I went Googling and it couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything specific to IIS Express but managed to use some guidance for full blown IIS.
The solution is to go to C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express\AppServer and open the applicationhost.</description>
