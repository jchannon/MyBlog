      <description>This post is mainly a reminder for me as I keep forgetting the command in Git to integrate commits to YouTrack items.
YouTrack uses TeamCity to get the information about the commits and then scans the commit comment for a YouTrack item id and any commands that it can apply such as item status or time spent on said item.
There is some documentation here but its not the greatest in terms of clarity and I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to Hadi Hariri from JetBrains about improving this so hopefully they&amp;rsquo;re working on it.</description>
