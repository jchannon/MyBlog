      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know I try to work on OSX as much as possible and with .Net that&amp;rsquo;s quite painful to be honest.  Things are moving along nicely with Jetbrains Rider,
VSCode, Xamarin and Omnisharp.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, none of them are perfect and I often find myself using Visual Studio in a VM because it just works (yes, its clunky etc etc).
Recently, VSCode got a 1.3 release with some new features, tabs being one of them.  I never really got on with VSCode so dismissed it most of the time but this new release
opened my eyes a bit more and thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go.  Its C# support now runs on .Net Core RTM and most of my work at the moment is porting projects to .Net Core so it seemed
this would be worthwhile.  I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to setup keybindings that are the ones I know from Visual Studio and installed couple of extensions to make things easier and prettier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As VSCode is language agnostic the one thing I found was how to build .Net Core projects was a bit off.  For each project you have you have to configure a task runner.  VSCode tries to
help you here and gives you a few languages to choose from.  For .Net Core it creates a &lt;code&gt;dotnet build&lt;/code&gt; task.  The problem with this is that it runs that command from the workspace root,
ie the folder where VSCode is opened.  What if you open it from the git root folder and your project(s) are under a src/MyProject folder?  It will fail as it cant find project.json.
What you can do is set the &lt;code&gt;cwd&lt;/code&gt; to be a specific directory by hardcoding it in the task configuration but thats not great if you have multiple projects.  You could use some predefined
variables that VSCode provides eg/&lt;code&gt;${fileDirname}&lt;/code&gt; but again if you are in a folder 4 levels deep that wont work either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
