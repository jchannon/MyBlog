If you can't beat them, join them is probably the best quote to sum up my experience with AI.

We have known for a long time AI is changing the way we work however we all know how unreliable it is and personally I have seen that for a long time when it "helpfully" suggests code suggestions as I type. I have also seen
how unreliable it is when using an AI Assistant to do something for me.

My conclusions have been "this thing is not going to take away people's jobs or take over the world, it's absolutely useless".

However, as time has gone on and models have got better and clearly AI is not going awayI decided I better try and learn some fundamentals of AI and try to find ways in which I can test it out.

Therefore this post will be an introduction for those still in the "this is useless" mindset which might help explain some concepts and how to use it so it can be more effective for you.
