      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve played with node in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/10/08/node-js-express-hello-world-formula-1-style/&#34;&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; but as of the new year I decided to try and make a more concerted effort to get stuck into node properly.  I decided to go back to the beginning to try and get a better appreciation for the language so read &amp;ldquo;JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford&amp;rdquo;.  I found that exercise fulfilling and resulted in a few light bulb moments that made some dots join up so I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###Real World App&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated earlier I have already played with node in the past using &lt;a href=&#34;http://expressjs.com/&#34;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; and have read quite a bit on node and read many examples but I wanted to write a non-web app as I felt this would give me a better opportunity to get to grips with the language and Node. Using Express allows you to get up and running very quickly without to much head scratching so I felt a standalone script would give me more exposure to things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
