      <description>As of beginning of April 2018 Botwin has been renamed to Carter. Whilst I thought the name was genius it became obvious that some people didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or understand it and tried to interpret it as a Bot framework for Windows. After spending too long trying to think of a new name I finally decided upon Carter. Carter comes from the surname of Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) and in his song Empire State of Mind he sings &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the new Sinatra&amp;rdquo;.</description>
