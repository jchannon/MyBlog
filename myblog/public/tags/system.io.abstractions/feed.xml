      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from my post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/25/is-oss-good-for-your-career/&#34;&gt;OSS&lt;/a&gt; I thought I would illustrate how cool OSS can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before that post was published I was working on a program that required the file system. All you good developers are going to know that the file system is a dependency and dependencies are bad and this post will probably be a bit like preaching to the choir however I thought it was worth posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have a a method similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void DoSomethingCool()
{
  //do some stuff now write to file

  FileInfo f = new FileInfo(&amp;quot;C:\Mytext.txt&amp;quot;)
  using(StreamWriter w = f.CreateText())
  {
    w.WriteLine(&amp;quot;This blog post is cool&amp;quot;);
    w.Close();
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are writing to a file to record something and need to test your method. Remember, unit tests are supposed to be fast. Typically anything that writes to a database or a file system will be slow however, we also have the problem that our method is now dependent on the file system and dependencies are bad. Wouldnâ€™t it be handy if we could make FileInfo a representation of an interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
