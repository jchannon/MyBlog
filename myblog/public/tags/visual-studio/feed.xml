      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was going to write a long post explaining about all the pain I went through to get this working but then realised you probably don&amp;rsquo;t really care and you just want the code!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A quick look at Visual Node</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visualnode.info/&#34;&gt;Visual Node&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago and was excited by the looks of it.  For those that didn&amp;rsquo;t click that link, it basically brings the power of Visual Studio debugging to a node.js app.  You can write your node.js app in Visual Studio, fire up the debugger by hitting F5 and use breakpoints and watches to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hipster in me is screaming saying &amp;ldquo;You should be using Sublime Text and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector&#34;&gt;node-inspector&lt;/a&gt; for debugging&amp;rdquo; but to be honest I found it a bit hackety-hack and it seemed a bit odd debugging my server app in Chrome but maybe that&amp;rsquo;s just something I need to get over.  JavaScript is getting a huge surge in popularity recently so its your duty as a developer to investigate this.  I want to learn and understand JS better but I always get frustrated with it after 10mins and swear that I&amp;rsquo;m never going to touch a dynamic language again, &amp;ldquo;give me a statically typed language every time with a compiler&amp;rdquo;.  I have a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde situation going on that I need to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
