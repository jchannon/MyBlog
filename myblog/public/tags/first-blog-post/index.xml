      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here I am, Jonathan Channon, blogger.  I never saw the point of blogging before so why now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read and spoken to many people regarding blogging who were all in favour of it.  I would always argue that I don’t have time, I have nothing to blog about or I’m not that insane to start blogging about stuff I barely understand just so the masses can come and hurl abuse at my ignorance.  However I recently read an &lt;a href=&#34;http://buildstarted.com/2012/08/28/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-my-community/&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/buildstarted&#34;&gt;Ben Dornis&lt;/a&gt; titled “How I learned to stop worrying and love my community”.  He outlined all the reasons why a lot of people don’t publish their code and don’t publish their thoughts online. I thought he was being modest, the man is clearly talented at what he does so he didn’t have to worry however, someone like me still had these fears.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
